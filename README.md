# PHP CRUD Application

Simple PHP CRUD Application

Learn how to start a simple PHP + MySQLi CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. Go step-by-step on how to get started with PHP and MySQLi the right way using your own local installation of WAMP.

As a new developer, you need to learn how to create a CRUD application. WordPress is essentially a layered CRUD application. If you are a PHP developer, learning how to build a CRUD application can be the difference between using WordPress forever or creating your own dynamic content management system.

Taking what we learned about creating a PHP + MySQLi CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application and making it more functional with a bit of style.

Now we can introduce Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and DataTables. I use Bootstrap because it easy to get started with and includes most of the CRUD application look we are needing. You can use other frameworks but I have found using Bootstrap as a basis is a great way to start your CRUD application development.

Next, we will use jQuery to populate our data with AJAX and will integrate jQuery Validation.

We will also take our 3rd party scripts and download, combine, minify, and optimize the workflow to make the CRUD application faster and more efficient.

Now that we have form validation, we are going to use PHP and Bootstrap to display update, delete, and create alerts that are stored as sessions.

I also have my first big issue recording while I code and discuss how I fix the issue as well as present my recording setup better.

We can now create custom styles to modify the presentation view for Bootstrap and DataTables.net.

Next, we will be setting up security and limiting access to only registered users.

In this part, we will be showing different interfaces based on security permissions.

By the end of this video, you will have completed the CRUD application development series and you will have a fully working, yet basic CRUD application that you can modify as you see fit.
